<h1> Why young Indians are sitting on a ticking time bomb of diseases </h1>
<h3> 2025 </h3>
<p> Doctors across India are witnessing a growing number of young adults grappling with chronic health issues, conditions once associated with older age are now appearing in people still in their teens or early twenties.

"A decade ago conditions like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and even fatty liver being diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s was rare," Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant in internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital told IndiaToday.in.

The shift, doctors warned, is not anecdotal but systemic and visible in health screenings across schools, colleges, and workplaces.

Early warning signs are now appearing even in adolescence. In one of India's largest student health assessments, nearly one-third of college students were found to be overweight, and about 19% were already showing elevated blood pressure.
At the heart of the problem is a radical change in how young Indians eat, sleep, work, and live. "This generation's environment is wired against health," said Dr Vishakha Shivdasani, a physician who specialises in disease reversal and longevity.

From morning cereal that's marketed as healthy but is nutritionally hollow, to energy drinks, screens, and processed meals, the daily lifestyle of the average young adult has drifted far from traditional, nutrient-rich patterns.

"Westernised diets low in fibre and protein but high in sugar and processed fat, have replaced homemade food. Most young adults are undernourished despite eating enough calories," Dr Shivdasani noted.

Add to that chronic stress, social pressure, erratic sleep patterns, and endless screen time, and it's a perfect storm.
Dr. Chatterjee pointed out that over two-thirds of people under 25 now show limitations in basic physical markers like strength, flexibility, and balance - traits that earlier declined much later in life.

The result: lifestyle diseases are showing up earlier and more aggressively.

While genetics can increase susceptibility, lifestyle choices are usually the deciding factor in whether a disease manifests.

Dr. Anamika Dubey, paediatrician at Rainbow Children's Hospital, said that one might carry a gene for diabetes or heart disease, but it's often the poor diet, inactivity, stress, and lack of sleep that activate it.

<b> <u>WHAT CAN YOUNG PEOPLE DO? </b> </u>

Despite the grim diagnosis, doctors believe there's hope if action is taken now. Small but consistent changes can reverse early disease and prevent chronic illness.
<ul>

<li>Get screened early, especially if there's a family history or visible lifestyle risks. </li>
<li>Focus on nutrition, not calories. Prioritise protein, fibre, and whole foods. </li>
<li>Build a sleep routine. Aim for at least 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. </li>
<li>Move daily. Even walking, yoga, or bodyweight exercises make a difference. </li>
<li>Question your sources. Follow advice from trained professionals, not trends. </li> 
<li>Address stress. Whether it's therapy, journaling, or breaks, mental health is key. </li> 
<li>As Dr Chatterjee puts it: "Your 20s set the stage for the next five decades. Don't wait for a crisis to take charge of your health." </li>
